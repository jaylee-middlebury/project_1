## The Bottom Line

It's the age-old problem: how do we get the most utility out of finite resources. In this case, how do we profit-maximize with our warchest? Do we engage in a nationwide push or are there states where targeted campaigns would yield the greatest ROI?

## Outside Research

Let's look at Illinois, Colorado, and Rhode Island given their uptake of SAT moving from 2017 to 2018.

Illinois jumped from 9% to 99%. With a bit of google-fu, we find out that it's actually due to politics - state contract was
awarded to The College Board after 15 years of ACT dominance.

Colorado posted similar stats, moving from 11% to 100%. Again, this boils down to politics.

Ditto for RI.

Interestingly, West Virginia is next up in line when it comes to the biggest movers apropos of the uptake of SAT from 2017 to 2018. Looking at the data, the state looks promising as the participation rate went from 14% to 28%, demonstrating a 100% increase. All that while ACT declined a mere 4 percentage point (69% to 65%). It feels much less of a zero-sum game there with the potential for the company to make inroads. Coupled with the upcoming changes to account for adversity, this is a great opportunity for the company to ingratiate itself with the policymakers to broaden SAT's exposure in WV.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

Lobby the board of education and the policymakers in WV.
